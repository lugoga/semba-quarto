We use rmarkdown to automate the report that contain formatted plain text, code,figures, table and reference As mentioned previous, an R Markdown file is simply a plain text with and `.Rmd` extension. \n\n## Data\nWe use the data `ChickWeight` from the base R **dataset** package. It has four variables;\n\n+ `weight`: a numeric vector with the body weight of the chick in gm\n+ `Time`: a numeric vector with the number of days since the birth when the record begin at day zero\n+ `Chick`: an ordered factor with levels that group chicks with the same diet together\n+ `Diet`: A factor with levels 1--4 indicating the type of feed used for experimental\n\nWe first need to load the tidyverse package developed by Hadley Wickham and others [@tidyverse]. We load using the `require()`function and used ggplot to make figure \\@ref(fig:fig1).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Performance of feed used to feed chicken for three weeks](rmarkdown_learning_files/figure-html/fig1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Reference\n",
