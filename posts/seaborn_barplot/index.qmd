## Introduction

In [Visualization with Seaborn](https://lugoga.github.io/semba-quarto/posts/seabornVisualization/) of this series, we were introduced on the power visualization and dove into distributions plot. In this post we are going learn barplot. The bar plot is used to capture the relationship between a categorical and numerical column. For each unique value in a categorical column, a bar is plotted, which by default, displays the mean value for the data in a numeric column specified by the bar plot. Seaborn has nifty function called `barplot()`, which is dedicated for this type of plot. 


## Loading libraries

Though most people are familiar with plotting using matplot, as it inherited most of the functions from MatLab. Python has an extremely nady library for data visualiztion called seaborn. The Seaborn library is based on the Matplotlib library. Therefore, you will also need to import the Matplotlib library.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

sns.set_theme()

```

## Dataset

We are going to use a penguin dataset from palmerpenguins package [@horst2022palmer]. We do not need to download this dataset as it comes with the seaborn package. We only need to load it from the package into our session using `sns.load_dataset` function and specify the `penguins` as the name of the dataset and assign it as df;

```{r}
#| echo: false
df = palmerpenguins::penguins

```

```{python}
#| echo: false

df = r.df
```


```{python}
#| eval: false
df = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```


```{python}
df.head()
```

A printed `df` dataset shows that is made up of various measurements of three different penguin species --- Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. The dataset contains seven variables -- species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year.


Next, we will call the `barplot()` function from the Seaborn library to plot a bar plot that displays the average length of penguin species.


```{python}
#| label: fig-fig1
#| fig-cap: Average length by island

fig = plt.figure()
sns.barplot(data=df, x="species", y="bill_length_mm")
plt.show()

```

The @fig-fig1 shows that the average length of penguins from the three island. We can parse an argument `hue = "sex"` to stack the plot as @fig-fig2 shows.


```{python}
#| label: fig-fig2
#| fig-cap: Average length by species and island


fig = plt.figure()
sns.barplot(data=df, x="species", y="bill_length_mm", hue = "sex")
plt.show()

```
