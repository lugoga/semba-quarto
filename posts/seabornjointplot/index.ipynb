        "In [part I](www.ims.org.tz) of this series, we were introduced on the power visualization and dove into distripubtion plot. In this post we are going focus on jointplot. `jointplot` is used to plot the histogram distribution of two columns, one on the `x-axis` and the other on the `y-axis`. A scatter plot is by default drawn for the points in the two columns. Seborn has nifty function called `jointplot()`, which is dedicated for this type of plot. \n",

The Seaborn library is based on the Matplotlib library. Therefore, you will also need to import the Matplotlib library.\n"
